# Introduction
HoloCollab is a software aimed at professionals with the primary goals of facilitating remote collaboration and enabling advanced insights through the use of interactive 2D and 3D resources.
The primary use cases focus on supporting multidisciplinary teams (MDT), merging the functionalities of multiple apps into a single cohesive environment.
Concretely, this resulted in a Microsoft Teams app that provides multiple whiteboards where meeting participants can collaboratively annotate and place additional resources like images, PDFs, text notes, and 3D models.
All interactions are synchronized across clients using Azure Fluid containers and the LiveShare SDK, and each member is served with the same shared app state rendered using React and Fluent UI elements.
Additionally, leveraging previous UCL projects under the HoloRepository umbrella, as well as state-of-the-art machine learning models from MONAI, we provided an avenue tailored to the needs of medical professionals to produce organ-segment 3D models from raw DICOM scans.
The models can then be imported into the collaborative environment, which provides a globally synchronized view of the 3D volumes handling rotation, scaling, and drawing on the modelâ€™s texture.
